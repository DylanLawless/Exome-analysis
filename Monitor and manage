1. monitor activity:
$ htop
quit: $ q
(https://codeahoy.com/2017/01/20/hhtop-explained-visually/)

2. List the sizes used and availability on the file system in a human readable format (Note /data).
$ df -h

3. See your files and directory sizes
In your data directory:
$ du -sh

A better breakdown from your current directory:
$ du -a -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr

or from anywhere:
$ du -a -h --max-depth=1 /data/username/ | sort -hr

4. Transfer files/folders
While logged into the server this sends the folder:
$ rsync -avz -P  /data/username/importnat_folder uni_username@ComputerName.leeds.ac.uk:/Users/uni_username/Desktop/

note: a trailing slash in the source (../temp/) will send all the files individually which you probably donâ€™t want.

Very fast:

rsync -aHAXv -e "ssh -T -o Compression=no -x" user@<source>:<source_dir> <dest_dir>

5. Current users and processes
$ w

6. Stephen Turner's bash oneliners

7. Tmux for detachable sessions and long jobs. Be careful not to nest sessions, and practice on you local machine to learn keybindings and how to find/kill sessions. If you are used to brew; brew install tmux.
Cheatsheet: https://www.cheatography.com/thecultofkaos/cheat-sheets/tmux-basics/
Basic configuration file to make tmux usable and logical: https://github.com/DylanLawless/tmux/blob/master/tmux.conf
Copy this or (or better, write it yourself to familiarise) to ~/tmux.conf
(window splitting and Set prefix to Ctrl-a are most intuitive).
